# Search-automation-in-Python
Works only on windows in Edge, Chrome and Firefox

Execute the .lnk file, which is a shortcut to the actual .exe file in the dist folder

Command line will prompt:

```
Enter a search query you want to make: github
How many searches do you want to make: 3
```

The search will open up on your default browser, given it is one of those three. I haven't implemented support for any other one.
